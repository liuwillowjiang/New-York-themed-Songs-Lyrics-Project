Oh Blackie's down by the railroad tracks (Shotgun Black, he's down by the railroad tracks) He sinks (he's sittin') low in the back seat of his Cadillac And Diamond Jackie, she's so intact She falls like an angel beneath him (She freezes like ice beneath Shotgun's attck) Now Jackie's heels are stacked (Oh Diamond's shoes are shellac) She got cleats on her boots Together they're gonna boogaloo down Broadway And come back (home) with the loot Because it's midnight in Manhattan This is no time to get cute It's a mad dogs' (madcap) promenade Singing a New York City serenade  Oh well ain't Jackie pretty, ain't she sweet Her fate lies at midnight between her teeth She got a dirty big (old) daddy who through all the years (tears) (whose fist pump like gears) Has supplied her with hope and kept her in fear Well now he's a lone privateer working down on the docks He was born in 1943 and almost died of the shock Now he comes home and drags her to some deep side joint Where all night long those (the eternal) punks they rock Until she breaks down and falls, soft (so helpless) like a child Cryin' "New York City, you're so wild" And in the night air you hear cryin'  Oh now the girls say anything, those girls say (cry) anything He was born on the border of that Kansas line When he broke into town the weather vane was hot, ninety degrees (it was the summer in '63) He swore he'd bust (break) that monster to his knees Now some folks said he was the master of the universe Some people say he was the holder of the cosmic keys Oh and his throat was choked with lightning From some childhood disease And with a tommygun blast he got the people screamin' Till he falls helpless (and he lies empty) in Times Square Just like streets scum Cryin' "New York City kills young" Cryin' "New York City kills young" And from a tenement window you hear cryin' (a baby cries)
I don't take coffee I take tea my dear I like my toast done on one side And you can hear it in my accent when I talk I'm an Englishman in New York  See me walking down Fifth Avenue A walking cane here at my side I take it everywhere I walk I'm an Englishman in New York  I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York  If, "Manners maketh man" as someone said Then he's the hero of the day It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile Be yourself no matter what they say  I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York  Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety You could end up as the only one Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society At night a candle's brighter than the sun  Takes more than combat gear to make a man Takes more than a license for a gun Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can A gentleman will walk but never run  If, "Manners maketh man" as someone said Then he's the hero of the day It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile Be yourself no matter what they say  I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York
Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood Hop a flight to Miami Beach or Hollywood. I'm taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line- I'm in a New York state of mind. I seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines, Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens, But I know what I'M needing and I don't want to waste more time- I'm in a New York state of mind. It was so easy living day by day Out of touch with the rhythm and the blues, But now I need a little give and take, The New York Times, the Daily News... It comes down to reality-and it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide, Don't care if it's Chinatown or Riverside, I don't have any reasons, I've left them all behind- I'm in a New York state of mind. REPEAT 3RD VERSE I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line- 'Cause I'm in a New York state of mind.
Do you see that thing I'm sure it's love Would you do one thing New York's in love The city grew wings  in the back of the night The clouds are stuck like candy-floss She sees the rich trash  having all the fun Makes her wonder where they get the energy from  There's nothing you can do to her This city's all clean and waiting I don't mean to wait too long But this joint can't get much higher  [CHORUS] New York's in love- With her big green eyes And her long blonde hair New York's in flames New York's in love With the way she talks And the way she walks New York's in love Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo  My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat No-one knows they've had their day We can dance and we can see the singles swing Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys. You're turned to stone by the family It's now the dead speak to the living Nothing left here  but a raging blaze I don't mean to wait too long  [CHORUS]
New york city, you're so pretty All your faces, going places And i believe if you fall in love I believe if you fall in love You should jump right in Always going, faster modem Cell phone fables, candle-lit tables I believe if you fall in love Yes, i believe if you fall in love You should jump right in I wrote our initials in the sidewalk cement Tattooed your name across my arm for all to see I wanna sing about it, sing about it, sing about it I've got your back from now on baby, you can count on me Only one life, kisses all night Kids round fountains, concrete mountains And i believe if you fall in love I believe if you fall in love You should jump right in
New York Girls (Can you dance the polka)      1. As I went down Boradway one evening last July,  I met an maid, she asked my trade, a sailor lad am I.   And away shanty, my dear Annie. Oh you New York girls, can’t you dance the polka?   2. To Tiffiney’s I took her I did not mind expense,  I bought her a pair of gold ear-rings and they cost me 15 cents.  And away shanty, ...   3. She said ‚my fine new sailor, now take me home you may‘  But when we reached her cottage door she this to me did say.  4. ‚My flash man he’s a Yankee with hair cut short behind  He wears a pair of tall sea boots and he sails the black bow line.‘  And away shanty, ...   5. He’s homeward bound this evening and with me he will stay  So get a move on sailor boy, get cracking on your way.  And away shanty, ...   6. I kissed her hard and proper before her flash man came  Saying ‚fare thee well, my bowery girl I know your little game‘  And away shanty, ...    7. I wrapped me glad rags round me and to the docks did steer  I‘ll never court another girl, I’ll stick to rum and beer.  And away shanty, ...   8. I joined a Ynakee blood boat and sailed away next morn‘  Don’t mess around with women, ladsm you’re safer round Cape Horn.  And away shanty ...
You called me last night on the telephone And I was glad to hear from you 'cause I was all alone You said, ";It's snowing, it's snowing! God, I hate this weather."; Now I walk through blizzards just to get us back together  We met in the springtime at a rock-and-roll show It was on the Bowery when it was time to go We kissed on the subway in the middle of the night I held your hand, you held mine, it was the best night of my life.  'Cause everyone's your friend in New York City And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see But the best thing about New York City is you and me  Statue of Liberty, Staten Island Ferry, Co-op City, Katz's and Tiffany's* Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, The Empire State where Dylan lived** Coney Island and Times Square, Rockefeller Center Wish I was there  You wrote me a letter just the other day Said, ";Springtime is coming soon so why don't you come to stay."; I packed my stuff, got on the bus, I can't believe it's true I'm three days from New York City and I'm three days from you  'Cause everyone's my friend in New York City And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see But the best thing about New York City is you and me  'Cause everyone's my friend in New York City And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see But the best thing about New York City is you and me.
Here in the streets so mechanised Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life Studied all the rules didn't want no part But I let you in just to break this heart Even though it was only one night It was fucking strange  Nina's in the bedroom She said time to go now But leavin' it ain't easy I got to let go I got to let go And the hours they ran slow I said everynight she just can't stop sayin' New York City cops New York City cops  New York City cops They ain't too smart New York City cops New York City cops  New York City cops They ain't too smart  Well, kill me now, I let you down I swear one day we're gonna leave this town Stop Yes I'm leavin'  'Cause it just won't work They act like Romans But they dress like Turks Sometime, in your prime See me, I like the summertime  Nina's in the bedroom She said time to go now But leavin' it ain't easy I got to let go I got to let go Oh!  Trapped in an apartment She would not let them get her She wrote it in a letter I got to come clean The authorities they've seen darling I'm somewhere in between I said everynight every night, I just can't stop sayin' New York City cops New York City cops  New York City cops They ain't too smart New York City cops New York City cops  New York City cops They ain't too smart

Und nach dem Abendessen sagte er  Laß mich noch eben Zigaretten holen gehn Sie rief ihm nach nimm dir die Schlüssel mit Ich werd inzwischen nach der Kleinen sehn Er zog die Tür zu ging stumm hinaus ins neonhelle Treppenhaus Es roch nach Bohnerwachs und Spießigkeit Und auf der Treppe dachte er  Wie wenn das jetzt ein Aufbruch wär Ich müßte einfach gehn Für alle Zeit Für alle Zeit Ich war noch niemals in New York Ich war noch niemals auf Hawaii Ging nie durch San Francisco in zerrissenen Jeans  Ich war noch niemals in New York Ich war noch niemals richtig frei Einmal verrückt sein und aus allen Zwängen fliehn  Und als er draußen auf der Straße stand  Fiel ihm ein daß er fast alles bei sich trug Den Paß die Eurochecks und etwas Geld  Vielleicht ging heute abend noch ein Flug  Er könnt ein Taxi nehmen am Eck Oder Autostop und einfach weg Die Sehnsucht in ihm wurde wieder wach Noch einmal voll von Träumen sein  Sich aus der Enge hier befrein Er dachte über seinen Aufbruch nach seinen Aufbruch nach Ich war noch niemals in New York Ich war noch niemals auf Hawaii Ging nie durch San Francisco in zerrissenen Jeans Ich war noch niemals in New York Ich war noch niemals richtig frei Einmal verrückt sein und aus allen Zwängen fliehn  Dann steckte er die Zigaretten ein  Und ging wie selbstverständlich heim Durchs Treppenhaus mit Bohnerwachs und Spießigkeit Die Frau rief: "Mann wo bleibst Du bloß?  'Dalli Dalli' geht gleich los"   Sie fragte: "War was?"   Nein was soll schon sein?   Ich war noch niemals in New York Ich war noch niemals auf Hawaii Ging nie durch San Francisco in zerrissenen Jeans Ich war noch niemals in New York Ich war noch niemals richtig frei Einmal verrückt sein und aus allen Zwängen fliehn

From the M-G-M Picture "The Belle Of New York" Words by Johnny Mercer Music by Harry Warren  Verse:  Lillian Russell is fabulous fair, So is the girl on that sign over there; Ah, but to capture the maid of my heart Challenges ev'ry photographer's art. Charles Dana Gibson would even agree No Stage-door John holds a candle to me.  Chorus:  When I'm out with the Belle of New York, With the beautiful Belle of New York, Ev'ry person we meet, like the cop on the beat Leaves whatever he's doing and crosses the street; It's a beautiful sight after dark, When we're strolling through Grammercy Park; The stars in her eyes and the moon up above Just fill me with oceans and oceans of love, And my heart bobs around like a cork When I'm out with the Belle of New York.

There's a part of the country could drop off tomorrow in an earthquake,  Yeah it's out there on the cutting edge, the people move, the sidwalks shake.  And there's another part of the country with a land that gently creaks and thuds,  Where the heavy snows make faucets leak in bathrooms with free-standing tubs.  They're in houses that are haunted, the with kids who lie awake and think about  All the generations past who used to use that dripping sink.   And sometimes one place wants to slip into the other just to see  What it's like to trade its demons for the restless ghost of Mrs. Ogilvey,  She used to pick the mint from her front yard to dress the Sunday pork,  Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York.   It wants to have a family business in sheet metal or power tools,  It wants to have a diner where the coffee tastes like diesel fuel,  And it wants to find the glory of a town they say has hit the skids,  And it wants to have a snow day that will turn its parents into kids,  And it's embarrassed, but it's lusting after a SUNY student with mousy brown hair who is  Taking out the compost, making coffee in long underwear.   And southern California says to save a place, I'll meet you there,  And it tried to pack up its Miata, all it could fit was a prayer,  Sometimes the stakes are bogus, sometimes the fast lane hits a fork,  Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York.   Tempe, Arizona thinks the Everglades are greener and wetter,  And Washington, D. C. thinks that Atlanta integrated better,  But I think that southern California has more pain that we can say,  Cause it wants to travel back in time, but it just can't leave L. A.   But now I hear they've got a theme park planned, designed to make you gasp and say,  Oh, I bet that crumbling mill town was a booming mill town in its day,  And the old investors scoff at this, but the young ones hope they'll take a chance,  And they promise it will make more dough than Mickey Mouse in northern France,  And the planners planned an opening day, a town historian will host,  And the waitresses look like waitresses who want to leave for the west coast.   And they'll have puttering on rainy weekends, autumn days that make you feel sad,  They'll have hundred year old plumbing and the family you never had,  And a Hudson River clean-up concert and a bundle-bearing stork,  And I hear they've got a menu planned, it's trés western New York.
In New York freedom looks like Too many choices In New York I found a friend To drown out the other voices  Voices on a cell phone Voices from home Voices through the hard sell Voices down a stairwell In New York Just got a place in New York  In New York summers get hot Well into the hundreds You can walk around the block Without a change of clothing  Hot as a hair dryer in your face Hot as handbag and a can of mace New York I just got a place in New York  New York New York   In New York you can forget Forget how to sit still Tell yourself you will stay in But it's down to Alphaville()  New York New York, New York  New York, New York New York  The Irish been coming here for years Feel like they own the place They got the airport, city hall The asphalt dance floor () They even got the police  Irish, Italians, Jews and Hispanics Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew Happily not like me and you That's where I lost you  New York New York, New York New York New York, New York  New York New York  In New York I lost it all To you and your vices Still I'm staying on to figure out Midlife crisis  I hit an iceberg in my life You know I'm still afloat You lose your balance, lose your wife In the queue for the lifeboat  You better put the women and children first But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York  New York New York New York, New York  In the stillness of the evening When the sun has had its day I heard your voice whispering Come away now  New, New York New...

I'm gonna work a couple a years here then I'm gonna go home where they treat women with respect and don't make 'em go out of the house and work That's how the home gets wrecked.";  If you want to meet a man from Pakistan you might try riding in a New York City taxi cab and if you are so inclined as to ask the man about his country I think that you will find it is a very different place from New York. I got in the cab and the man started to tell me about his family and he said ";Miss are you interested in my country?"; And I said ";Yes."; So there we were and I found out about his country. ";Well"; he said ";l come from a place that is so much more relaxed than here"; and he told me that I would not believe the difference and I said to him ";How would you explain it to me?"; And he said ";l'm gonna work a couple a years here and then I'm gonna go home where they treat women with respect and don't make 'em go out of the house and work.";

Written by Carlo Nuccio Main Voice: CARLO Produced by Continental Drifters Released on 'Continental Drifters' (1995) You said it from New York With a tear in your eye You said it from a pay phone I say it was a lie 'Cause you said it with indifference I heard it that way too And even the color blind Know what's black from white, oh right. And you don't have to shout I hear you fine I'm not tryin' to wear you out But don't expect me to ease you It seems such an injustice Given the way we feel I guess sometimes It just turns out like that. All handle each rejection Kinda tired, rather careless, I find it hard to breathe And if you don't want to see me cry Don't ever say goodbye. I can't pin it on him Girl, I can't blame you From the ring on your finger I guess I always knew It seems such an injustice Given the way we feel I guess sometimes It just turns out like that. All handle each rejection Kinda tired, rather careless, I find it hard to breathe And if you don't want to se me cry Don't ever say goodbye. Don't ever say goodbye. You said it from New York With a tear in your eye You said it from a pay phone I say it was a lie 'Cause you said it with indifference And I'm sure I heard it true And even the color blind Know about ya. I am, girl I'm so scared of bein' alone In this place so faraway From what I call home If you don't want to see me cry Don't ever say goodbye. Don't ever say goodbye Don't ever say, don't ever say Don't ever say, don't ever say, owe.
[Instrumental]
I can see you now by the light of the dawn, And the sun is rising slow, We have talked all night, and I can't talk anymore, But I must stay and you must go; You have always been such a good friend to me, Through the thunder and the rain, And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York, Lift your heart and think of me; There are those who fail, there are those who fall, There are those who will never win, Then there are those who fight for the things they believe, And these are men like you and me; In my dream we walked, you and I to the shore Leaving footprints by the sea, And when there was just one set of prints in the sand, That was when you carried me; You have always been such a good friend to me, Through the thunder and the rain, And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York, Lift your heart and think of me; When you're feeling lost in the snows of New York, Lift your heart and think of me, Lift your heart and think of me.
I'm gonna ask you for something, and it may sound like a lot. I've never really asked you for anything, no. We've always lived so far apart  Chorus: Would you fly all the way from New York to see me? Could you fly all the way to stand here next to me? I didn't think so But here you are with me.  I was hanging on to nothing as a child. And my brother, he used to slam into walls Everyone called him wild Yes it's been a while since I've had a day, Where I don't wish away all the fear, all the fear That's why it's so hard to ask  (Chorus)  Thank you for coming. You'll never know what it means (ah..ah) 'Cause no one ever cared enough about you How were you supposed to know what I need You'll never know what it means But thank you for coming.  (Chorus)

[Chorus to fade]  Back, back, back, back, and forth  from Ca-li to New York
When my heart is torn apart  by love I wish I had,  Well, I spend my nights in the city's lights  and things don't seem so bad.  Ya know the movement seems to soothe me,  and the temp takes control,  and I lose my blues  when the Ne w York City rhythm fill my soul   it's the New York City rhythm  runnin' thru' my life,  the pounding beat of the city streets  that keeps mydreams alive.  I'm lost, I'm found, I'm up, I'm down,  but somehow I survive.  It's got to be the New York City  rhythm in my life,  It's got to be the New York City  rhythm in my life, in my life.   When I'm out for love or sin,  Oh, it's good to be in town,  In the funky dives on the old west sid  there's always somethin' goin' down.  Oh yes , I live my life with strangers,  and the danger's always there,  but when I hit Broadway and it's time to play,  ya know that I don't care   Chorus
In the event of something happening to me,  there is something I would like you all to see.  It's just a photograph of someone that I knew.   Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones  Do you know what it's like on the outside  Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.   I keep straining my ears to hear a sound.  Maybe someone is digging underground,  or have they given up and all gone home to bed,  thinking those who once existed must be dead.   Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones  Do you know what it's like on the outside  Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.   In the event of something happening to me,  there is something I would like you all to see.  It's just a photograph of someone that I knew.   Hvae you seen my wife, Mr. Jones  Do you know what it's like on the outside  Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.
Going nowhere fast, watching cars go past  Why won't the snow melt faster  This trip is a disaster  16 hour drive, just played in some dive  New York to nowhere, we're never gonna get there   A million miles away from everyone I know  Stuck here night and day with 5 more days to go
I'm going down, and I don't know when I'm coming up again Oh I'm going down said I don't know when I'm coming up again. When did I slip Where did I miss you When did I trip over you and when will I fly over you oh I'm going down  and I don't know when I'm coming up again. [x2] Dark has come I'm not afraid though I can become anyone and I don't want anyone, no I'm going down and I don't know when I'm coming up again Oh I'm going down said I don't know when I'm coming up again There was a love, I shot it down There was a trust, I shot it down Oh there was a life, I shot it down
Rambling out of the wild west Leaving the towns I love best Thought I'd seen some ups and down  'Till I come into New York town People going down to the ground Building going up to the sky.  Wintertime in New York town The wind blowing snow around Walk around with nowhere to go  Somebody could freeze right to the bone I froze right to the bone  New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years  I didn't feel so cold then.  I swung on to my old guitar  Grabbed hold of a subway car And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride I landed up on the downtown side:  Greenwich Village.  I walked down there and ended up  In one of them coffee-houses on the block Got on the stage to sing and play  Man there said, Come back some other day You sound like a hillbilly  We want folksingers here.  Well, I got a harmonica job begun to play  Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day I blowed inside out and upside down  The man there said he loved my sound He was raving about he loved my sound  Dollar a day's worth.  After weeks and weeks of hanging around  I finally got a job in New York town In a bigger place, bigger money too  Even joined the Union and paid my dues.  Now, a very great man once said  That some people rob you with a fountain pen It don't take too long to find out  Just what he was talking about A lot of people don't have much food on their table But they got a lot of forks and knives  And they gotta cut something.  So one morning when the sun was warm  I rambled out of New York town Pulled my cap down over my eyes  And heated out for the western skies So long New York  Howdy, East Orange.
New York, you're such a fickle city  You've got a heart  But you won't admit it  You've got a soul  And I'd like to get in it  But you can't have  My dreams in exchange   'Cause I came to you  With an open mind  With my heart full of hope  Of a special kind  But the doors stayed closed  For the longest time  So I thought of inside  Wondering what I might find   But you played with my illusion  'Till my image laughed in my face  I would have loved to love you  But my heart needs a different space   New York, New York ...

I'm lost in a world of lights Mesmerize my nights The sky scrapes on buildings sites I'm feeling so alive  Whatever's clever Whatever's clever will have to wait  Thinking on the world at large The city's got it all Culture clash and sidewalk trash Don't look down you might fall  And now we just feel like energy New York city will never sleep And now we just feel like synergy New York city it's the place to be  I'm gonna win I'm gonna lose I'm gonna chase it till the end And if you're walking in my shoes You're gonna make it or pretend  Whatever's clever Whatever's clever will have to wait  And now we just feel like energy New York city will never sleep And now we just feel like synergy New York city it's the place to be
New York to that tall skyline I come  Flying in from London to your door  New York looking down on Central Park  Where they say you should not wander after dark  New York like a scene from all those movies But you're real enough for me  But there's a heart  A heart that lives in New York   A heart in New York  A rose on the street  I write my song to that city heart beat  A heart in New York  Love in her eye  An open door at a friend for the night   New York you got money on your mind  And my words won't make a dime's worth a difference So here's to New York
Many years since I was here, On the street I was passin' my time away To the left and to the right, Buildings towering to the sky It's outta sight in the dead of night Here I am, and in this city, With a fistful of dollars And baby, you'd better believe  Chorus: I'm back, back in the New York Groove I'm back, back in the New York Groove I'm back, back in the New York Groove Back in the New York Groove, In the New York Groove  In the back of my Cadillac A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' 'Where are we?' Stop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night It's gonna be ecstacy, This place was meant for me  Feels so good tonight, Who cares about tomorrow So baby, you'd better believe  chorus  I'm back, back in the New York Groove (repeats out)

Baby , oh no , I've been stuck here I've been searchin' so long  Baby don't go , millions of people were wrong In the dark of the cold light of day , I will still be here If my heart and my soul had their way , you would still be here   Another lonely night in New York  The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down 'Cause my baby's no longer around  And my feeling can never be found  Another lonely night in New York And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world   Baby , you said , a guy like me was way out of line And knowing today , your leavin' was a question of time In the mist of a sweet summer rain ,you will find me here Should the sparkle of stars lose their way , I'll be holdin' near  Another lonely night in New York The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  'Cause my baby's no longer around  And my feelings can never be found  Another lonely night in New York And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world   (break)  In the dark of the cold light of day ,  you will find me here If my heart and my soul had their way , you would still be here  Another lonely night in New York  And I'm just a soul in the heart of the city Just another lonely night in New York  The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  Just another lonely night in New York ( fade )
(J. Wozniak) Come see the vampires of New York Come lose your mind in Central Park But don't leave your soul behind  Come take in 8th street after dark Such peculiar people you'll remark You might even see a murder And all the whores on Blecker Street They wear the blissful grin Caused by the drugs they take To relieve them of their sins And ";oh lord I think she's dying"; I head somebody say I think she's dying And ";oh lord I think she's dying"; Or maybe she's already dead and maybe she's gone to Mars Maybe we could write her epitaph in the stars It'd say ";If you go away from here..If you go a million miles..."; Come downtown to see them go Into the den of the vampires of New York But please watch your step as you're getting off, kids
I came down from Albany to New York to find what I'd been missin' I looked across the river to the city where the windows all stood glistenin' I stood listenin' Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside, but I was young and able When I came out the other end, ah through the smoke the winter light was feeble Unreadable I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go I thanked him A face of white a face of brown, here a smile, there a look of danger For a stranger  It was too unreal for me I found no one who trusted me There was no man could offer me A cold hand from New York  Cold hands from New York  A voice within you cries won't someone please help me I'll do the same for you one day If you should ever pass my way and need me  I came down to live alone in New York the city of the living There were fortunes at my feet but most of men were taking, none we giving Or forgiving Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways I saw them There were men who lived in style and others who had died where no one knew them 'Cause they couldn't win There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms where babies crept unwanted Till I began to ask myself if there was hope or if it mattered what the did Or if they lived  It was too unreal for me I found no one who trusted me There was no man could offer me A cold hand from New York  Cold hands from New York  A voice within you cries won't someone please help me I'll do the same for you one day If you should ever pass my way and need me  I came down from Albany to New York to find what I'd been missin' I looked across the river to the city where the windows all stood glistenin' I stood listenin' There were prophets in the squares and people there who smiled and said forget it There were lovers in the park and there was danger in the dark, I felt it So afraid of it There were preachers of the word and poets who were never heard I heard them There were those who would not try to learn the measure of the lie They're livin' I heard a young musician play in a place where they paid you not to listen I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by and offered their best wishes That's how it is  It was too unreal for me I found no one who trusted me There was no man could offer me A cold hand from New York  Cold hands from New York  A voice within you cries won't someone please help me I'll do the same for you one day If you should ever pass my way and need me
Start spreading the news I'm leaving today I want to be a part of it, New York, New York These vagabond shoes Are longing to stray And make a brand new start of it New York, New York I want to wake up in the city that never sleeps To find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap These little town blues Are melting away I'll brand a brand new start of it In old New York If I can make it there I'll make it anywhere It's up to you, New York, New York.  I want to wake up in the city that never sleeps To find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap These little town blues Are melting away I'll brand a brand new start of it In old New York If I can make it there I'll make it anywhere It's up to you, New York, New York.
It's too late to stop her now In her red shoes She believes in fairytales - you can't stop the blues Everybody loves that girl - everybody on this world Oh, she has it all - she got sex like a dreammachine Everynight she's dancing like a fire in my dream She's still a mystery Oh, she wants everything  Was it just a dream on golden wings ? She danced in Rio and she danced in Tokyo On every stage she's doing her midnight show She danced in N.Y., Berlin, Paris all the time She danced in Rio and she danced in Tokyo In every town she's dancing her succesful roll She danced in Rio, N.Y., Berlin, Paris all the time Oh, it's too late to stop me now Let the music die Find the magic of the night .............. Everybody loved that girl - everybody on this world She danced the uptempo rhapsody like ...................... in the snow Every night she temped the fire baby she would know She's still a mystery - she wants everything Was it just a dream on golden wings ?
Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood Hop a flight to Miami Beach  or Hollywood. I'm taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line- I'm in a New York state of mind. I seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines, Been high in  the Rockies under the evergreens, But I know what I'M needing and I don't want to waste more time- I'm in a New York state of mind. It was so easy living day by day Out of touch with the rhythm and the blues, But now I need a little give and take, The New York Times, the Daily News... It comes down to reality-and it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide, Don't care if it's Chinatown or Riverside, I  don't have any reasons, I've left them all behind- I'm in a New York state of mind. REPEAT 3RD VERSE I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line- 'Cause I'm in a New York state of mind.
Well I feel just like a freight train baby, running out of steam. I wanna go on down to New York town, but I'm stuck in between. And I could stay on here at home alone and have myself to thank, But I just made a billion dollars and I wanna put it in the bank, So if you call... we could go to town. Well dear mom,  if you could see me now here underneath the lights I gotta keep 'em on from dusk to dawn and everything's alright. I met a girl with autumn in her eyes and summer in the way  She makes me feel like I was only born today or yesterday, And if she calls... we could go to town. But everybody here hates everything I say, and girl I just don't know if I can last another day. So I guess I'm going back, back where I belong, I hope you come along before I get back on that train that takes me... home from New York City  to the things I left behind And 'though I ain't got no money girl , I'll always have the time. But I wish that you would hurry, I hope you get here soon 'cause I just sold the sky to the sun so I could buy for you the moon. And if you call... we could go to town. So if you call... yeah, if you call... girl, if you call... we could go to town.

Harry got up  Dressed all in black  Went down to the station  And he never came back  They found his clothing  Scattered somewhere down the track  And he won't be down on Wall Street  in the morning   He had a home  The love of a girl  But men get lost sometimes  As years unfold  One day he crossed some line  And he was too much in this world  But I guess it doesn't matter anymore   In a New York Minute  Everything can change  In a New York Minute  Things can get pretty strange  In a New York Minute  Everything can change  In a New York Minute   Lying here in the darkness  I hear the sirens wail  Somebody going to emergency  Somebody's going to jail  If you find somebody to love in this world  You better hand on tooth and nail  The wolf is always at the door   In a New York Minute  Everything can change  In a New York Minute  Things can get a little strange  In a New York Minute  Everything can change  In a New York Minute   And in these days  When darkness falls early  And people rush home  To the ones they love  You better take a fool's advice  And tak care of your own  One day they're here;  Next day they're gone   I pulled my coat around my shoulders  And took a walk down through the park  The leaves were falling around me  The groaning city in the gathering dark  On some solitary rock  A desperate lover left his mark,  "Baby, I've changed. Please come back."   What the head makes cloudy  The heart makes very clear  The days were so much brighter  In the time when she was here  But I know there's somebody somewhere  Make these dark clouds disappear  Until that day, I have to believe  I believe, I believe   In a New York Minute  Everything can change  In a New York Minute  You can get out of the rain  In a New York Minute  Everything can change  In a New York Minute

I watch the sky turn black to blush Head still spinning from the rush Of all the things I did the night before  And looking down from my hotel These dawn-lit streets begin to fill With memories of you and I On a New York City night  I shake my head to clear the sounds The traffic horns, the growing crowd The sun awaking over central park  But still it creeps beneath my skin All of these heartbeats in the din With concrete dreams stirring to life On a New York City night   And I take it with me when I leave The crowded skyline, the energy The sleepless city always leaves its mark  Just close my eyes and I'm back again The neon flush upon our skin Still wrapped in thoughts of love and wine On a New York City night
I don't like cities But I like new york Other places make me feel like a dork Los Angeles is for people who sleep Paris and London Baby you can keep  [Chorus] Other cities always make me mad Other places always make me sad No other city ever made me glad except New York I love New York [X3]  If you don't like my attitude Then you can F off Just go to Texas Isn't that where they golf  New York is not for little pussies who scream If you can't stand the heat Then get off my street [repeat]  [Chorus]  I love New York [repeat] Get off my street [repeat]

(Tom Meltzer)   Once I had a sweetheart She meant the world to me I met her on the road one night when we were in Tennessee   I met her in a barroom after we'd done a show We sat and talked about the Louvins 'til the 'tender called time to go   She wrote her address on a napkin I wrote mine on my CD She said, ";It was sure nice talking to you"; I said, ";You'll be hearing from me";   I wrote her a letter the next day She wrote one in return The letters we wrote each other could have made the mailbox burn   Yo-de-lay-he-he-hoo   I wrote her a long letter and told her that I loved her so And if she'd come to New York to the altar we would go   I sent it with a dozen roses and I waited for her reply Til the day the letter came my way that made me want to die   It said, ";I know that you love New York So wild and fancy free And I love you, dear,  But I also love my home in Tennessee   Now I know that you'd be no more happy here than in the city I would be So though I love you dear  I'm gonna stay right here Home in Tennessee";   Yo-de-lay-he-he-hoo   And now I know I will never wed But a bachelor I'll always be 'Cause my heart belongs to a pretty girl down in Tennessee   Yo-de-lay-he-he-hoo
When you chew my ear off, try and let me know You will never get another piece of me Cause in a New York blackout, things go kinda slow And you miss the things you never thought you'd see  There's still so many things I want to be Sometimes I just don't even want to sleep  In a New York blackout, it's so hard to see All the angels that are looking after me  The lies bounce off the water in your eyes And the dead lift their heads and come alive  And I may never escape this darkened city But still I'm trying to find you in this blackoutWhere it's warm inside and always open late And the doors to hell look just like heaven's gate And you never know what's going on inside 'Til you step out in the cold and seal your fate  And you might just stop in and say hello But you've got much more important places to go Make sure you let everybody know  That I may never enlight this darkened city Still i'm trying to find you in this blackout  In a New York blackout, you might think I'm gone But I'll wake up on the front steps of your door

I've been here since eighty-one That's a long time And I've seen All there is here to see  Had a space on Astor place Had it all once Now there streets Are my reality  You see New York City Don't mean nothing Just a good place when you're running Light that cut so bright they make you bleed  Neon children live their lives there Mad magicians tinsel nightmares Still you know I'm never gonna leave  Never sleep alone on the subways Never walk alone on the tracks Never take a ride to the edge of your mind Not unless you have a ticket back Don't believe in T.V. preachers Don't believe in talk show stars Never follow trends if they turn on your friends Just to be sure you know who your friends areAnd if you're running blind On a refueled mind Better watch the time And careful you don't go too far  Never burn the bridges before you If you've burned the bridges behind And never burn the one that you're walking upon Or you're sure to hit the water in time  Don't believe in expectations Don't believe in shooting stars And if you make a stand on a dead empty hand Never let them see your cards  And if you're running blind On a refueled mind Better watch the time And careful you don't go too far

by the garbage cans the sits  in her hands she holds a plastic bag  she borrowed from the supermarket  her eyes starring holes into the night  open windows are her radio  luxury for her backyard bed  she knows every story  of all the gloom and glory  this city wrote through all the years  you can't miss her cause she is  always talking to a mailbox  whispering secrets right into  the darkness where you can't hear her  speak or talk but believe me that she is  the princess of new york  down 5th avenue she walks  dragging her body round the block  trying to collect her meal  the parking meters are her friends  for each one she's got a name  hello eddie how are you today ?

There's a little child Running round this house And he never leaves He will never leave And the fog comes up from the sewers And glows in the dark  Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast Grow up fast Anything you want it can be done How did you go bad? Did you go bad? Did you go bad? Somethings will never wash away Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
New York   Was it Washington Square  Or the way you wore you hair?  Was it central park  Or kissing after dark?  Guess I'll never know  Not sure I even care  But my heart will always live  With you and me there   But I can't afford to live in N.Y.C.  Ahahahah  And she can't afford to leave  Ahahah  Was it the Sea Port in June  Or your face by the moon?  Was it Soho's charm  Or you and I arm in arm?  Was it the 6 train uptown  Or true love that I found?  It all blends into one  When I think of you now   But I can't afford to live in N.Y.C.  Ahahahah  And she can't afford to leave  Ahahah   Well I know that a promise is to keep  But money's tight and I've been losing sleep  Old Man Circumstance will have his way  It's true  But what I wouldn't give to stay here with you   And I can't afford to live in N.Y.C.  Ahahahah  And she can't afford to leave  Ahahah   And I've never been good with good-byes  But good-byes are all I have
(Chorus)  New, New New, Ah, ah-ah ah  New, New New, Ah, ah-ah ah  New New York Skyline  Wounds they heal in time  Don't crawl and don't despair  It's a new New York Today   I look across these city streets  My heart is numb, it still beats  Nothing to say  There's nothing to say   I look across this empty room  My heart is still in bloom  There's nothing to say  I only can pray   (Chorus)  I look across these city streets  My heart is cold it beats  30th of may  Ground zero today   (Chorus)  I get down on my knees and pray  For the heroes of the day  And no comfort I can find  For the loved ones left behind   They won't tear us apart X4  No way  New day  New day
When my heart is torn apart  by love I wish I had,  Well, I spend my nights in the city's lights  and things don't seem so bad.  Ya know the movement seems to soothe me,  and the temp takes control,  and I lose my blues  when the Ne w York City rhythm fill my soul   it's the New York City rhythm  runnin' thru' my life,  the pounding beat of the city streets  that keeps mydreams alive.  I'm lost, I'm found, I'm up, I'm down,  but somehow I survive.  It's got to be the New York City  rhythm in my life,  It's got to be the New York City  rhythm in my life, in my life.   When I'm out for love or sin,  Oh, it's good to be in town,  In the funky dives on the old west sid  there's always somethin' goin' down.  Oh yes , I live my life with strangers,  and the danger's always there,  but when I hit Broadway and it's time to play,  ya know that I don't care   Chorus
Into the abyss, perpetual and torturous The gallery of suicide, internal torment Archaic carcasses, displayed degeneracy Once within these walls a life of death will be unleashed  Forever dying are the dead, countless bleeding heads Cadavers splattered red from the self-slicing of necks Stenching maggot filled bodies, skulls and bones rot away The slaughtered souls that chose to die, enveloped in death  Darkness is the only light, suicide the way Hideous forms of human death, mounds of flesh slowly decay Embrace the horrid nature, carnage on display  Pain never felt Enslaved inside this massive grave Life, evil fate Only slaves to death can survive this place Die, perdition Penance in putrid decadence Dead miscreants Enter the decrepit necropolis  Lurid interment in the hellish abattoir Impetuosity and horror, after-life is tortured Entrails, guts, and blood is this museums decor  Blood, impiety Chastened are the sanguinary Purge, radical They perish, the victims of vagary Vile tragedy With great vehemence the hapless died Kill, suicide Serrated blades assist in destiny  Death opened the gallery Sarcophagus Ecstasy in suffering Imprecation  [Solo - Owen]  Blood, impiety Chastened are the sanguinary Purge, radical They perish, the victims of vagary
(Shane MacGowan/J. Finer)  It was Christmas Eve babe  In the drunk tank  An old man said to me, won't see another one  And then he sang a song  The Rare Old Mountain Dew  I turned my face away  And dreamed about you  Got on a lucky one  Came in eighteen to one  I've got a feeling  This year's for me and you  So happy Christmas  I love you baby  I can see a better time  When all our dreams come true  They've got cars big as bars  They've got rivers of gold  But the wind goes right through you  It's no place for the old  When you first took my hand  On a cold Christmas Eve  You promised me  Broadway was waiting for me  You were handsome  You were pretty  Queen of New York City  When the band finished playing  They howled out for more  Sinatra was swinging,  All the drunks they were singing  We kissed on a corner  Then danced through the night  The boys of the NYPD choir  Were singing ";Galway Bay";  And the bells were ringing out  For Christmas day  You're a bum  You're a punk  You're an old slut on junk  Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed  You scumbag, you maggot  You cheap lousy faggot  Happy Christmas your arse  I pray God it's our last  The boys of the NYPD choir  Were singing ";Galway Bay";  And the bells were ringing out  For Christmas day  I could have been someone  Well so could anyone  You took my dreams from me  When I first found you  I kept them with me babe  I put them with my own  Can't make it all alone  I've built my dreams around you  The boys of the NYPD choir  Were singing ";Galway Bay";  And the bells were ringing out  For Christmas day
I got a fist full of dollars and a one track mind I gotta find what I'm looking for in the dead of night 3rd and 4e buildings to the sky I've got one last chance to get high to get high New York City might be the place to be If your game is tight and if your green takes flight Take another chance on the place that don't sleep Creep on the sidewalks listen as she sleeps  I'm back and I'm down for whatever Tribe Called Quest is in the CD player Trik Turner bill boards in Time Square No west coast G's just east coast players Strike up a Newport sippin on my import gotta get that buzz For them clubs that be what I see Ok MCs in my pathway better make room I'm divin' deep into the groove  It's been a long time since I got down Been a long time since I got down baby So take a look around it ain't nothing nice If your caught slippin' just another Day in the life of that New York living Where fast times makes for fast ways  In and out with the latest craze It takes more than the average to amaze The typical New Yorker can make you  Or break you either way it changes you To something that you thought you'd never be From rags to riches or riches to rags Everyone plays a part you can see on The faces of places and things that you've Never seen it's all about the dollar dream Owning millions have a penthouse in the tallest Buildings I'm going all the way forget what The critics say its all about them royalties If you don't like it then suck on these!

There's just soemthin' about this hotel Got me wishin' I was dead. Got to get out of New York City, Somewhere I can clear my head.  I was just kickin' along the sidewalk, No one looks you in the eye, No one asks you how you doin', Don't seem to care if you live or die.  I just got to get me somewhere, Somewhere that I can feel free, Get me out of New York City, son, New York City's killin' me.  It was just outside of Nashville, I met the woman of my dreams. Sure would like to get to know her, Maybe find out what it means.  I get so tired of all this concrete. I get so tired of all this noise. Gotta get back up in the country, And have a couple drinks with the good ole' boys.  I just got to get me somewhere, Somewhere that I can be free, Get me out of New York City, son, New York City's killin' me.

Since you left me darling  The city doesn't feel right  On the street the music stopped  And the light seem half as bright  Without your love  This old town's no fun at all  Without your love  I only hear the loudest voices  The one's with something new to sell  And now it's all  Big talk, big name, big noise, New York   I walk from the river to West Broadway  Every stranger spoke your name  Every sign read 'yesterday'  Without your love   This old town's no fun at all  Without your love  I only see the drifting shadows  Of the losers and the lost  And now it's all  Big talk, big name, big noise, New York   There was a time  When the night was just for dancing  Till the sun rose over the skyline  But now you're gone  And the fear of winter grows  Just a place where the money flows  And there never was a springtime   Another season begins fast and loud  It's supposed to be a party  But to me, it's just a crowd   Without your love  This old town's no fun at all  Without your love  I'm left with all the memories darling  Of words I thought were true  But it was all  Big talk, big name, big noise, New York  Well, it was all  Big talk, big name, big noise, New York

Well, I shuffled through the city on the 4th of July I had a firecracker waiting to blow Breakin' like a rocket who makin' its way  To the cities of Mexico Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th Had myself a lover who was finer than gold But I've broken up and busted up since  And love don't play any games with me Anymore like she did before The world won't wait, so I better shake That thing right out there through the door Hell, I still love you, New York  Found myself a picture that would fit in the folds Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good Still amazed I didn't lose it on the roof of the place When I was drunk and I was thinking of you Every day the children they were singing their tune Out on the streets and you could hear from inside Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd I would wait for you and I'd try to hide  And love won't play any games with me Anymore if you don't want it to The world won't wait and I watched you shake But honey, I don't blame you Hell, I still love you, New York Hell, I still love you, New York New York  I remember Christmas in the blistering cold In a church on the upper west side Babe, I stood their singing, I was holding your arm You were holding my trust like a child Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue B But I tried to keep the overhead low Farewell to the city and the love of my life At least we left before we had to go  And love won't play any games with you Anymore if you want 'em to So we better shake this old thing out the door I'll always be thinkin' of you I'll always love you though New York I'll always love you though New York, New York, New York

You can cry by my window You can crawl on the floor You can scream if you want to But I won't unlock the door  You can sleep in bus shelters You can sleep in the park But I'll rip up the trees Until you tear yourself apart  But I don't love you No I don't love you Do you dream?  Back to surveillance Open eyes and wash out 'tear' A sign that says 'no exit' And 'no-one can save you here'  I could talk about my programme Where everything is white I could specialise in pictures Where nothing's ever right  But I don't love you No I don't love you Do you dream?  We are just sound We are just noise And we are all here to lie Do you dream?  You sleep by windows You sleep by windows  Do you cry? Do you dream? Do you? Did you?
I'll stand even when life has got me down And my hopes and dreams are no where to be found Still I stand cause I know I'm too close to give up now I put it all in your hands and just stand (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  Stand, even when nights seem cold, and Stand, when you can't feel your soul, and Stand, when your dark past won't seem to go away, help me say, you can Stand, God is right by your side, and He will make everything all right so, if you can (lift your hands) let's plan and just stand  If I cry, it's all right, cause it may be just what I need Cause everybody hurts sometimes, and every heart needs relief Still I know where to go, to the one who understands So no matter what tomorrow may bring, still I stand  Stand, even when nights seem cold, and Stand, when you can't feel your soul, and Stand, when your dark past won't seem to go away, help me say, you can Stand, God is right by your side, and He will make everything all right so, if you can (lift your hands) let's plan and just stand  Everybody help me say... Even if you fall still know that you can just stand, you can just stand... If you can, lift your hands, let's plan, if you just stand  If you Stand, even when nights seem cold, and Stand, when you can't feel your soul, and Stand, when your dark past won't seem to go away, help me say, you can Stand, God is right by your side, and He will make everything all right so, if you can (lift your hands) let's plan and just stand  If you stand... Help me... Lord, I know...  If you can, let's plan, stand
Well all these people of the city will keep you in their blind spots Especially when they know that you're out looking to sign dots I tried to tell this girl how twisted my mind got But it's her dream to ride the conveyer belt of that side walk She's got intentions of being number one But can she handle rejection in the city of no sun Where bricks change colors faster than careers do And few people drive away and like what's in their rearview  New york city's so far away But i can't wait even for one more day They say these things come and these things go But if I don't try I'll never know  She don't care what it takes she knows she's got the ability And with what her folks make You know she'd have stability She just needs to get out there And step toward her validity She can't keep dying over this Because it's just killing me She's not used to foot steps digging in her chest High heeled investments and suit's getting undressed Growing hold and having new recruits become the best And finding that she's stepped on everyone and no one's left  Well it hurts like walking barefoot on light bulbs Smashing ideas with open skin Til' the pearl white dorps of blood turn red And everyone can tell That you've worked hard enough It's time to go Go get your map and compass and don't listen to them And don't think about how much time you're fixing to spend The dirt only ends when the pavement begins This is your heart your dream And you're your only friend so go  You can kick the earth as hard as you want To show your frustration Or you can get in your car and kick your foot to the gas And keep accelerating till you hit your destination So go

I'll tip the newsboy I'll get a shine I'll ride this dream to the end of the line I'm goin places I'll take a ride Up to the Riverside I'll take NY I'll let it happen I'll pop the cork tear off the wrappin' I'll make a splash on the Hudson that's how I will arrive Hey, do you have two tens for a five? Roll out the carpet Strike up the band break into the best champagne when I land Beat the parade drum hit all the bars  I want the moon and stars But I'll take NY I'll make it happen Blow out the candlels tear off the wrappin' And I know someday they'll have to name a street after me
It was Christmas Eve babe In the drunk tank An old man said to me, won't see another one And then he sang a song The Rare Old Mountain Dew I turned my face away And dreamed about you Got on a lucky one Came in eighteen to one I've got a feeling This year's for me and you So happy Christmas I love you baby I can see a better time When all our dreams come true They've got cars big as bars They've got rivers of gold But the wind goes right through you It's no place for the old When you first took my hand On a cold Christmas Eve You promised me Broadway was waiting for me You were handsome You were pretty Queen of New York City When the band finished playing They howled out for more Sinatra was swinging, All the drunks they were singing We kissed on a corner Then danced through the night The boys of the NYPD choir Were singing ";Galway Bay"; And the bells were ringing out For Christmas day You're a bum You're a punk You're an old slut on junk Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed You scumbag, you maggot You cheap lousy faggot Happy Christmas your arse I pray God it's our last I could have been someone Well so could anyone You took my dreams from me When I first found you I kept them with me babe I put them with my own Can't make it all alone I've built my dreams around you
She came from New York Seems like a bright spark Knew all the answers to the game Moved to a new town Soon pushed her way around But you're a lady just the same She went the wrong way Tryin' to catch that boy He only used her Then broke her like a toy Like a New York broken toy Moved with the wrong pack Hard headed, well stacked Drop her guard if you drop her name Made all the wrong moves Knew all the lines to use Too many got burned in her flame She went the wrong way Tryin' to catch that boy He only used her Then he broke her like a toy Like a New York broken toy Since the news got around Someone I brought up town Needed a friend but no one came She tried to change her views But still she wasn't bad news Don't ever lose at your own game She went the wrong way Tryin' to catch that boy He only used her Then he broke her like a toy Like a New York broken toy.

I can see you now by the light of the dawn, And the sun is rising slow, We have talked all night, and I can't talk anymore, But I must stay and you must go; You have always been such a good friend to me, Through the thunder and the rain, And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York, Lift your heart and think of me; There are those who fail, there are those who fall, There are those who will never win, Then there are those who fight for the things they believe, And these are men like you and me; In my dream we walked, you and I to the shore Leaving footprints by the sea, And when there was just one set of prints in the sand, That was when you carried me; You have always been such a good friend to me, Through the thunder and the rain, And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York, Lift your heart and think of me; When you're feeling lost in the snows of New York, Lift your heart and think of me, Lift your heart and think of me.
I don't take coffee I take tea my dear I like my toast done on one side And you can hear it in my accent when I talk I'm an Englishman in New York  See me walking down Fifth Avenue A walking cane here at my side I take it everywhere I walk I'm an Englishman in New York  I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York  If,  Manners maketh man  as someone said Then he's the hero of the day It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile Be yourself no matter what they say  I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York  Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety You could end up as the only one Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society At night a candle's brighter than the sun  Takes more than combat gear to make a man Takes more than a license for a gun Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can A gentleman will walk but never run  If,  Manners maketh man  as someone said Then he's the hero of the day It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile Be yourself no matter what they say  I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York I'm an alien I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York

Franky was a mook from the block we used to live on  The wanna be gangster;  The wanna be dapper Don, Don John on  the wall, I'm your biggest fan  next to my little brother Paul.  Losing his grip, like Pesci, he'd flip  if you talk to his brother he says they  always planned this trip  he wasn't oky-dokie running around like  Don Quixote, trying to free a man he  didn't even know B.  He had the roots he bought the suits  but the boys didn't like him mto tell you the truth  he had 'J.G.' on his pinky ring and he  lied about doin' some time up in sing-sing  he flipped one fine summer afternoon  he told his brother Paulie, something had to be done soon.  He took Paulie and a couple of boys and jacked the  Coup de Ville to Illinois.   La-di da-di, free John Gotti, 'The King of New York'   He got a clipper from a stripper, he met at a club  two sticks of dynamite and a .38 Snub  he tried to see the Don, without an invitation  stood outside the gate with his three man demonstartion  waving picket signs, the C.O. saw a nine;  and only Paulie go away with the skin on his behind.  Back in the borough the cops are acting  thorough; they raided Franky's room  and then they saw his bureau; upon it was a note,  with a rhyme that was dope, about  how he was breaking John out and how he couldn't cope.  It sait, 'I don't fly coach, never save the roach,  The King of New York'.   La-di da-di, free John Gotti, 'The King of New York'

I don't drink coffee I take tea my dear  I like my toast done on the side  And you can hear it in my accent when I talk  I'm an Englishman in New York   See me walking down Fifth Avenue  A walking cane here at my side  I take it everywhere I walk  I'm an Englishman in New York   I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  I'm an Englishman in New York  I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  I'm an Englishman in New York   If  manners maketh man  as someone said  Then he's the hero of the day  It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile  Be yourself no matter what they say   I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  I'm an Englishman in New York  I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  I'm an Englishman in New York   Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety  You could end up as the only one  Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society  At night a candle's brighter than the sun   Takes more than combat gear to make a man  Takes more than license for a gun  Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can  A gentleman will walk but never run   If  manners maketh man  as someone said  Then he's the hero of the day  It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile  Be yourself no matter what they say   I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  I'm an Englishman in New York  I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  I'm an Englishman in New York
It was Christmas Eve babe In the drunk tank An old man said to me, won't see another one And then he sang a song The Rare Old Mountain Dew I turned my face away And dreamed about you Got on a lucky one Came in eighteen to one I've got a feeling This year's for me and you So happy Christmas I love you baby I can see a better time When all our dreams come true  They've got cars big as bars They've got rivers of gold But the wind goes right through you It's no place for the old When you first took my hand On a cold Christmas Eve You promised me Broadway was waiting for me  You were handsome You were pretty Queen of New York City When the band finished playing They howled out for more Sinatra was swinging, All the drunks they were singing We kissed on a corner Then danced through the night  The boys of the NYPD choir Were singing "Galway Bay" And the bells were ringing out For Christmas day  You're a bum You're a punk You're an old slut on junk Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed You scumbag, you maggot You cheap lousy faggot Happy Christmas your arse I pray God it's our last  I could have been someone Well so could anyone You took my dreams from me When I first found you I kept them with me babe I put them with my own Can't make it all alone I've built my dreams around you
Was it Washington Square  Or the way you wore you hair  Was it central park  Or kissing after dark  Guess I'll never know  Not sure I even care  But my heart will always live  With you and me there   But I can't afford to live in N.Y.C.  Ahahahah  And she can't afford to leave  hahah  Was it the Sea Port in June  Or your face by the moon  Was it Soho's charm  Or you and I arm in arm  Was it the 6 train uptown  Or true love that I found  It all blends into one  When I think of you now   But I can't afford to live in N.Y.C.  Ahahahah  And she can't afford to leave  Ahahah   Well I know that a promise is to keep  But money's tight and I've been losing sleep  Old Man Circumstance will have his way  It's true  But what I wouldn't give to stay here with you   And I can't afford to live in N.Y.C.  Ahahahah  And she can't afford to leave  Ahahah   And I've never been good with good-byes  But good-byes are all I have
