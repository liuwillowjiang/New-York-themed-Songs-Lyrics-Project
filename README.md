# hello-world
This is a lyrics project in which I scraped hundreds of New-York-themed songs from MLDB to see what words occured most in these lyrics, so that we can tell what people sing about when they sing about "New York"

The definition of "New-York-Theme" songs is simple: I only checked the songs of which titles include "New York"

I scracped both single and bigram words to make it more accurate
